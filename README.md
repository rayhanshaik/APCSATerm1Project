Our program can record the attendance of up to 10 people and mark them as present, absent, or tardy. We will use numbers to input attendance. 1 for present, 2 for absent, 3 for tardy. We will use case statements, so if they input anything else besides numbers 1-3 for attendance, it will make them redo it.  After that, the teacher will input the kid's initials for attendance. This will repeat 10 times. If they put in anything besides two letters as their initials, we will make the program shoot an error message back and make them try again. It will not record attendance past ten people, and it will not be able to show attendance after input.
